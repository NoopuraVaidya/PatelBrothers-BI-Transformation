## Machine Learning Models

As part of this project, we implemented machine learning models in Python to support decision-making:

1. **Sales Forecasting (Regression)**  
   - Predicts future sales trends using historical data.  
   - Model: Linear Regression  

2. **Customer Segmentation (Clustering)**  
   - Groups customers into segments based on demographics and spending patterns.  
   - Model: KMeans Clustering  

3. **Customer Attrition (Classification)**  
   - Predicts which customers are likely to stop shopping.  
   - Model: Random Forest Classifier  

üìÇ You can find the full implementation here:  
üëâ [`ml_models.py`](./ml_models.py)

Details of model selection, evaluation, and implementation are included in the [Project Report](PateL_Brothers_Report.docx).
